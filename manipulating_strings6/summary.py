#! Summary

# Text is a common form of data, and Python comes with many helpful string methods to process text stored in string values
# Make use of indexing, slicing, and string methods in almost every Python program

# Programs we're writing don't seem sophisticated, no GUIs with images and colorfol text
# We're displaying text with print() and input()
# But the user can quickly enter large amounts of text through the clipboard
    # This provides a useful avenue for writing programs that manipulate massive amounts of text
# These text-based programs might not have flashy windows or graphics, but they get a lot of useful work done quickly

# Another way to manipulate large amounts of text is reading and writing files directly off the hard drive. Chapter 9

# That's most the basic concepts of Python programming! More to come
