# What is the difference between lists and tuples?

# 13. Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable

# Actual:
# Lists are mutable; they can have values added, removed, or changed.
# Tuples are immutable; they cannot be changed at all
# Also, tuples are written using parentheses, ( and ), while lists use the square brackets, [ and ].
