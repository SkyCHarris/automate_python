    "1. Asks the user if they'd like to know how to keep an idiot busy for hours\n",

    "Of course we dont' know if the user will enter something besides \"yes\" or \"no so we need to perform input validation. Also, it would be convenient for the user to be able to enter \"y\" or \"n\" instead of the full words.\n",

    "PyInputPlus's inputYesNo() function will handle this for us and no matter what case the user enters, return a lowercase 'yes' or 'no' string value."
